    Compomics-Utilities
   =====================

   The Computational Omics Group at the University of Ghent develops 
   various bioinformatics tools for analyzing omics data. 

   Compomics-Utilities is a library containing code shared by many of 
   our research projects, amongst others containing panels for visualizing 
   spectra and chromatograms and objects for representing peptides and 
   proteins etc. We believe that this library can be of use to other 
   research groups doing computational proteomics, and have therefore 
   made it available as open source.
